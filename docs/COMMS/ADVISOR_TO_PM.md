### 2026-07-07#2 — Open Games list restyle (recessed navy panel)            [OPEN]
From: Advisor   Re: Designer request — Open Games list

Sanity-check result: all three claims verified against the code, premise is correct. The one file to touch is `apps/web/src/components/hub-shared/OpenGames.tsx` — specifically the shared `TickerBody`, `EmptyTicker`, and `TickerRow`. Because both `OpenGamesTicker` (signed-in) and `PublicOpenGamesTicker` (logged-out) render through these, one edit covers the Home hub and every game hub, both states. No doc pins this styling — no spec edit needed. Self-contained file, not the App.tsx collision zone → good for a standalone/second agent.

Two corrections to the brief before implementing (charter: tokens, not hardcoded values):

1. The navy the Designer wants already exists as a token: the PLAY/bet/Play-a-Friend container (`GameHub.tsx:715`) uses `bg-surface` → `--rc-surface #1a1a2e`. The list must use that same token, not a new navy hex. (Its current grey is `bg-card #151515`.)
2. The inset shadow must use the background token, not literal `#0B0B0B`. `#0b0b0b` is `--background`.
3. The current row divider `border-[#1e1e1e]` is a hardcoded hex matching no token — this ticket fixes that latent violation while recoloring.

Changes (file `apps/web/src/components/hub-shared/OpenGames.tsx`):

1. Panel color — `TickerBody` (line 60) and `EmptyTicker` (line 82): replace `bg-card` → `bg-surface`. Identical navy to the PLAY panel.
2. Remove rim, add recessed inset — same two elements: delete `border border-border`; keep `overflow-hidden rounded-[14px]`; add a background-token inset shadow, e.g. Tailwind `shadow-[inset_0_0_24px_8px_hsl(var(--background))]`. Tune blur/spread to taste — the visual target is edges melting into the page background, no hard boundary. (Overlay-gradient-frame is an acceptable alternative technique; must resolve to the `--background` token.)
3. Purple row separators — `TickerRow` (line 27): replace `border-[#1e1e1e]` → the brand purple token `border-brand` (`--brand-purple #8140e2`). Recommend starting at reduced opacity (`border-brand/40`) and tuning — a full-strength hairline reads too hot. Keep `border-t` and `first:border-t-0`.

Done when:

- List background is `bg-surface`, pixel-identical to `hub-section-play`; no visible border/rim on the list or the empty state; a soft inset shadow reads as recessed, edges fading into `#0b0b0b`.
- Row dividers are brand-purple hairlines via token (opacity-tuned), no hardcoded hex; first row has no top divider.
- No hardcoded colors introduced anywhere in the change (`bg-surface`, `hsl(var(--background))`, `border-brand` only).
- Verified on Home hub + one game hub, signed-in and logged-out; ¢ stake formatting and `text-success` unaffected (no $/USDT).
- `OpenChallengesList.test` and the `*Hub.test` suite pass; update any assertion that pins the old `bg-card`/`border-border`/`#1e1e1e` classes.

Ask: ticket this to one agent (single file, no collision zone). Confirm the divider opacity with the Designer if /40 looks off.

### 2026-07-07#1 — Worktree cleanup + standing layout            [ANSWERED]
From: Advisor   Re: your 2026-07-07#2 (WSL diagnostic)

Your read is right: 16 clean worktrees, each 1-ahead as a squash-merge artifact, all mapping to merged PRs → prunable. Recommendation:

1. Prune all 16 except `rapidclash-gcs` until `feat/gcs-snapshot-restore` (#140) is confirmed merged/closed. Use `git worktree remove <path>` (not `rm -rf`, so git's metadata stays consistent), then `git worktree prune`, then delete the merged local branches (`git branch -D <branch>`). Leave the `rapidclash-demo` clone as-is; its `uncommitted=6` is untracked scratch only.
2. If #140 is still open, keep only that one worktree.
3. Standing layout: one parent — `~/projects/rapidclash/` (the clone, main) — with worktrees under `~/projects/rapidclash/.wt/<issue>-<slug>` (mirrors branch names, e.g. `.wt/143-needs-bet`). Keep ≤2 active worktrees at once — it makes the ≤2-agent cap physically visible — and prune on merge as a standing PM habit so `projects/` never re-crowds.

Ask: none — FYI. On your confirmation I'll add a short "Repo layout" section to CODER_BRIEF.md recording the `.wt/<issue>-<slug>` convention.
